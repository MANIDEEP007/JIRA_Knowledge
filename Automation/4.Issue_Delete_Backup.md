* It is quite common that some issues will be getting deleted in Jira
* For backup, we can collect details via Automation when an issue is deleted and sent to one common mail
* Sometimes, based on the issue type, the communication mail has to be changes
* Fortunately, Jira automation provides if-else blocks to achieve this
* Under Project settings, go to Automation sub section
* Under Automation section, go to Rules tab
* Then click Create rule and select Issue triggers
* Under Issue trigger, choose Issue deleted
* Then click New condition and choose If / else block
* Under that choose If / else block, add new JQL condition with issuetype = "Bug"
* Under the same block click New action and choose Send email
* Choose the subject and content
* Come out of the If / else block and repeat the same for other issuetypes
* Sample body for taking backup
* In sample backup body, values inside {{}} will be replaced dynamically
